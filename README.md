Convert MP3, AAC/ALAC, FLAC, OGG/Opus, AIFF, CAF, and more to WAV in fast, reliable batches. Choose exact sample rate/bit depth (16/24/32-int or 32-float), keep channel order, and optionally normalize to target LUFS with true-peak safety. Tags map to BWF/iXML where sensible; file names and folders follow your tokens.
